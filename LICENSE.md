# The Johnson City Guide License

## The Fun Part üéâ

By using this repository, you agree not to plagiarize, steal, or otherwise act in ways that your grandmother would disapprove of. Violators may be subjected to legal action, or worse, eternal shame and the disapproving head-shake of the entire Johnson City community.

If you're a lawyer reading this and you find yourself chuckling, give us a call. We'll probably hire you (or at least buy you a coffee at our favorite local spot).

## The Legal Part ‚öñÔ∏è
